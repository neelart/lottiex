A customizable plugin for adding Lottie animations to your WordPress site.

== Description ==

**Lottiex**, your go-to source for adding responsive Lottie animations to your WordPress website. 

This plugin shines a light on the importance of sharing and contributing to the open-source community. 

Our story begins with a simple need: to incorporate smooth, versatile Lottie animations into a WordPress website. We found numerous plugins that could achieve this, yet none were as customizable and flexible as we needed. 

So we sought the help of a freelance developer who crafted this plugin to our exact specifications. When the job was done, the plugin worked like a charm, elevating our website to new heights.

However, as we delved deeper into the code, we realized the plugin was built upon the groundwork laid by another excellent open-source project base: [LottieFiles â€“ JSON Based Animation Lottie & Bodymovin for Elementor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/include-lottie-animation-for-elementor/) by KAP ASIAs. 

It dawned on us that this was more than just a tool; it was the fruit of the hard work and dedication of passionate developers who chose to share their work freely for the betterment of the entire community. Our plugin, Lottiex, was standing on the shoulders of giants.

So, we decided that it was time to give back. To show our gratitude for their contributions and to encourage others to follow suit, we've decided to open-source Lottiex under the GPL license. and also included free of cost with my themes and wp bundles too. 

Thank you, KAP ASIAs and the open source community!
